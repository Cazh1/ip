# Hi there! I am KenergeticBot 

I am a personal Task managing chatbot, able to store tasks such as To dos, Deadlines and Events.

## Here are some of the things I can do!

Create 3 types of Tasks:
<details>
 1. Todo: Tasks which are not time sensitive.
 2. Deadline: Tasks which are time sensitive, able to indicate deadline using /by.
 3. Event: Tasks which are happening at a specific time frame, using /from and /to.
</details>

Keep track of Task completion.
<details>
 1. [ ] Indicates Tasks that are not completed
 2. [X] Indicates Tasks that are completed
</details>
      
Store and retreive your tasks into a dedicated save file.
